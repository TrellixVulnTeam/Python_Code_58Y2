An empty street
An empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone
The rooms are getting smaller
I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had
The songs we sang together
Oh yeah
And all my love
I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue
To see you once again, my love
Over seas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green
To see you once again, my love
I tried to read
I go to work
I'm laughing with my friends
But I can't stop
To keep myself from hinking
Oh no
I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had
The songs we sang together
Oh yeah
And all my love
I'm holding on forever
Reaching for…

Baby, life was good to me
But you just made it better
I love the way you stand by me
Through any kind of weather
I don't wanna run away, just wanna make your day
When you feel the world is on your shoulders
I don't wanna make it worse, just wanna make us work
Baby, tell me I will do whatever
It feels like nobody ever knew me until you knew me
Feels like nobody ever loved me until you loved me
Feels like nobody ever touched me until you touched me
Baby, nobody, nobody until you
Baby, it just took one hit of you
Now I'm addicted
You never know what's missing
Till you get everything you needed
I don't wanna run away just wanna make your day
When you feel the world is on your shoulders
I don't wanna make it worse just wanna make us work
Baby, tell…

Don't bury me
Don't lay me down
Don't say it's over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under
I die everytime you walk away
Don't leave me alone with me
See, I'm afraid
Of the darkness and my demons
And the voices, sayin' nothing's gonna be okay, Heeyyy
I feel it in my heart, soul, mind that I'm losing
You, me, you're abusing
Every reason I have left to live.
Don't bury me
Don't lay me down
Don't say it's over
'Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under
Lost trust, 21 grams of soul
All the sanity I've ever owned, gone
But I'm…
